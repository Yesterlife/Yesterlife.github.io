I often laugh at myself as a failed exam-taking player. In the domestic education environment, I have not always maintained high-quality exam-taking ability. However, I think I am an active learner who is willing to apply what I have learned and try new things in practice.

After failing the postgraduate entrance exam, I was offered an environmental protection position at Sinopec and other state-owned enterprises. I think this is also something lucky.

Before graduation, I tried a variety of internships, including water pollution control (process design, etc.), communication industry (code transparency/solution optimization) and new media operation editing, etc., which suits my major.

After graduation, I am engaged in water treatment related work and have accumulated some field experience and design experience. However, without several years of practice and training in this industry, I will still be like a beginner.

So, give yourself a relatively accurate position: no matter what position, you still need to continue to learn and practice.
